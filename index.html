<div class="journey">
    <p>I visited <strong>Dhaka</strong> last month. It was my first journey by train. I never journey by train before. So it was very excited moment for me. I have collected ticket one week past. I reached in Bottholi station just on time. And I searched my boggi. I found my seat near the window. The train wistshel and started journey.</p>
